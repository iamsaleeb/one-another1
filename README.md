- **Event management** — Create, edit, and cancel events with optional registration, capacity limits, and custom attendee fields
- **Series** — Group recurring events into series with configurable cadences (weekly, biweekly, monthly)
- **Churches** — Browse church profiles, view service times, and follow churches
- **Roles** — Three-tier role system: `ATTENDEE`, `ORGANISER`, and `ADMIN`
- **Authentication** — Email/password sign-up and OAuth via [Auth.js v5](https://authjs.dev)
- **Push notifications** — Event reminders sent via FCM to Android and iOS devices, with per-user opt-out preferences
- **Mobile** — Native Android and iOS apps via Capacitor

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database
- Android Studio or Xcode (for mobile development)
- Firebase project (for push notifications)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/oneanother"
AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret"

# Firebase (push notifications)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js development server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build |
| `npm run start` | Start the production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run the test suite |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |

## Push Notifications

Push notifications are delivered via [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) and work on both Android and iOS native builds.

### How it works

1. **Token registration** — When the app opens on a native device, `PushNotificationProvider` requests permission and registers with FCM. The FCM token is sent to `/api/push/register-token` and stored in the `PushToken` table.
2. **Scheduling** — Server actions write rows to the `ScheduledNotification` table when users attend events. Each row contains the user ID, notification type, scheduled time, and message payload.
3. **Delivery** — An external cron service (cron-job.org) calls `GET /api/cron/event-reminders` every minute. The handler checks the user's opt-out preferences and sends via `firebase-admin` `sendEachForMulticast`.
4. **Stale token cleanup** — Tokens that FCM rejects as invalid or unregistered are automatically deleted from the database.

### Notification types

| Type | When sent |
|---|---|
| `EVENT_REMINDER` | Before an event the user is attending (configurable: 1h, 2h, 4h, or 24h — default 2h) |
| `NEW_SERIES_SESSION` | When a new session is added to a series the user follows |
| `EVENT_CANCELLED` | When an event the user is attending is cancelled |
| `EVENT_POSTPONED` | When an event the user is attending is rescheduled |

### Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Add Android and iOS apps using bundle ID `com.oneanother.app`.
3. Download `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place them in the respective native project directories.
4. Generate a service account key: **Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key**.
5. Add the three `FIREBASE_*` variables from the downloaded JSON to `.env.local`.

> **Important:** `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` must use literal `\n` for newlines in `.env.local`, not actual line breaks.

### Cron job setup

Notification delivery is triggered by an external cron service calling the API endpoint once per minute. Set up a job on [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (or any equivalent service) with:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| URL | `https://your-domain.com/api/cron/event-reminders` |
| Method | `GET` |
| Header | `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` |
| Schedule | Every 1 minute (`*/1 * * * *`) |

Add `CRON_SECRET` (a long random string) to your environment variables, then use the same value in the cron-job.org request header.

To trigger the endpoint manually during local development:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/event-reminders" -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer <CRON_SECRET>" }
```

### User preferences

Users can opt out of individual notification types at **Profile → Notifications**. All notifications are enabled by default (opt-out model). A `NotificationPreference` row is only written when the user disables a type or saves a custom config (e.g. a non-default `EVENT_REMINDER` lead time); re-enabling with no custom config deletes the row. Preferences are checked at send time, so changes take effect immediately even for already-scheduled notifications.

## Mobile (Capacitor)

The app is configured as a Capacitor project under the app ID `com.oneanother.app`.

**Android:**
```bash
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

**iOS:**
```bash
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

For local development with a physical device, update the `server.url` in `capacitor.config.ts` to your machine's local IP address.
